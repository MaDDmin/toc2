# Metronome

Simple metronome app.

Some time ago I was looking for open source metronome apps which could help me keeping time while practicing music. Unfortunately, the available apps seemed to be quite rare and I didn't find one, which I really liked. 
Since I wanted to try app developing some day, I took this as a chance and created this (hopefully) simple app.

# Functionality

This app provides basic functionality like:
* Setting speed manually or by "tap in"
* If you use "tap in" while the metronome is running, the klicks should lock in to your taps.
* Choose different sounds and individually adapt the volume
* Save and load your current settings
* Choose between light and dark theme
* Show a notification, which supports "start" and "stop"

# Help me improving the app

If you like this app, but have ideas for improvement or are annoyed by some behaviour, please let me know.
